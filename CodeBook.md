# Code book for run_analysis.R script

run_analysis.R implements the course project of ”Getting and Cleaning Data”
at Coursera / John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health

## How the script works

This R script does the following:
* Reads the raw data files
* Merges the raw training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Merges activity and subject ids to data set
* Labels the data set with the variable names. 
* Converts activity ids to factor variable and labels the activities
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean (mean()) and standard deviation (std()) for each measurement. 
** From the data set created by previous steps, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average, e.g., mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.
** Writes the second data set to disk with file name getdata-007-means.txt

The script assumes raw data is located in the working directory in subdirectory "UCI HAR dataset". Thus, to use the script you need only extract (unzip) the data set from course project page and run the script.

The source code is fully commented so please have a look.

## Data Set Information

The raw data set contains data from ”Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set” study.  
The original study and data set has been described < href=”http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones”>here</a>. 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Variables

Each variable contains the mean for each subject and activity of corresponding variable in the original data set. The ’mean’ variables in the generated data set have the same names in the original data set. Refer to the original data code book for more information about the variables.
