Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================
This repository contains 3 files:
* run_analysis.R - R script that cleans the raw data set
* CodeBook.md - code book describing the variable in the generated data set
* READMR.md - this file

# run_analysis.R
This R script does the following:
** Merges the raw training and the test sets to create one data set.
** Merges activity and subject ids to data set
** A ppropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
** Converts activity ids to factor variable and labels activities
** Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
** From the data set created by previous steps, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
** Writes the second data set to disk with file name getdata-007-tidy.txt

# CodeBook.md
This is the code book for the data set generated by run_analysis.R
